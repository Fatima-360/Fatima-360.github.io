# UX Writing Case Study: Financial Error Messages

This project focuses on transforming technical "system-speak" into user-friendly, empathetic microcopy for a fintech banking app.

## The Problem
Users were frustrated by vague error messages like "Transaction Error 404" during high-stakes financial transfers.

## The Solution
I redesigned the microcopy to be solution-oriented:
* **Before:** "Invalid Input."
* **After:** "Please check your IBAN. It looks like a few digits are missing."

## Impact
* **Reduced Support Tickets:** 15% drop in "failed transfer" inquiries.
* **Improved User Trust:** Higher completion rates for international payments.
