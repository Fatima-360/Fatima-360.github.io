# My Technical Writing Workflow 🛠️

As a specialist in Fintech documentation, I follow a structured "Docs-as-Code" workflow to ensure accuracy, compliance, and scalability.

### 1. Research & Data Analysis (Excel + Stripe)
Before writing, I use **Microsoft Excel** to analyze raw financial data or common error logs. 
* **Action:** I use Excel to filter "Edge Cases" (rare errors) that need specific documentation.
* **Verification:** I use the **Stripe Dashboard (Test Mode)** to walk through the payment flow manually, ensuring my instructions match the actual user interface.

### 2. Information Architecture (Trello/Jira)
I manage my writing tasks using **Agile methodologies**.
* **Tracking:** Every guide begins as a card in **Trello/Jira**, where I track progress from *Research* → *Drafting* → *SME Review* → *Published*.

### 3. Content Creation (Markdown + Git)
I write exclusively in **Markdown** to keep documentation lightweight and developer-friendly.
* **Version Control:** I use **Git** to manage versions. This allows me to work on "Branches" (drafts) without affecting the live site until the content is approved.
* **Automation:** I utilize **GitHub Actions** to automatically deploy documentation updates to the live site.

### 4. Quality Assurance (SME Review)
No Fintech document is complete without a **Subject Matter Expert (SME)** review. I use **Slack** to collaborate with Developers and Compliance Officers to verify that my instructions are 100% legally and technically sound.
